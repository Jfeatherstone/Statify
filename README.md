# Statify

![example image](https://github.com/Jfeatherstone/Statify/blob/master/example.png)

An app to create a low-dimensional, quantitative representation of your Spotify music library, based on audio features of your songs.

Live demo is currently WIP! I am currently setting up the app to be hosted on Azure.

## Running it yourself

After installing all of the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`), you can run the demo from the main folder using flask:

```
flask run
```
